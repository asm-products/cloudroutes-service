            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p>Users of PaperTrail can define unique [Alerts](http://help.papertrailapp.com/kb/how-it-works/alerts/) that call outside services such as Email, PagerDuty or even a generic Webhook. This monitor will create a unique webhook endpoint that you can configure PaperTrail to call when it detects an Alert. This integration allows you to combine CloudRoutes Reactions with PaperTrail alerts.</p>

            <h3>Monitor Details</h3>

            <p>Upon creation the below URLs will be unique for the created monitor. You can use these unique URLs as the webhook URLs for PaperTrail.</p>

            {% if data['monitor'] %}
            {% set apiid = data['monitor']['cid'] %}
            {% set apikey = data['monitor']['url'] %}
            {% else %}
            {% set apiid = "example-api-id" %}
            {% set apikey = "example-api-key" %}
            {% endif %}

            <p>
            <b>Unique Failed URL:</b>
            </p>
             <pre>https://dash.cloudrout.es/api/papertrail-webhook/{{ apiid }}/{{ apikey }}/failed</pre>

            <p>
            <b>Unique Healthy URL:</b>
            </p>
             <pre>https://dash.cloudrout.es/api/papertrail-webhook/{{ apiid }}/{{ apikey }}/healthy</pre>

            {% if data['monitor'] %}
            <p class="text-primary">The details above and below are unique to this monitor</p>
            {% else %}
            <p class="text-warning">When you create or edit a monitor these details will show the monitors unique information</p>
            {% endif %}

            <p>Since PaperTrail does not send healthy webhook events this monitor has two URLs, one for failed alerts and another for healthy alerts. Once a monitor is marked failed it will not be marked healthy until the healthy URL is also called. It is best practice for every failed alert in PaperTrail to create a second alert for healthy states.</p>
