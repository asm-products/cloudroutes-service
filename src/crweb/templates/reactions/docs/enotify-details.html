            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p>The Email Notification reaction is used to send email notifications to any specified email address. This email notification can be used to integrate with other systems that accept notifications via emails such as PagerDuty or BigPanda.</p>
            <p></p>
            <h3>Reaction Actions</h3>

            <p>This reaction has two types of actions, one is executed when the attached monitors return "Failed" and another is executed when the attached monitors return "Healthy".</p>

            <p></p>
            <h4>Failed Monitors</h4>
            <p>When this reaction receives a "Failed Monitor" it will send an email notification of the failure that includes the name of the Monitor affected. This reaction can be attached to each monitor without fear of an inbox onslaught, as this reaction will only send 1 email per monitor. Once an email is sent regarding the failure a second email will not be sent until the monitor has returned to a "Healthy" status and is then changed back to a "Failed" status.</p>
            <p></p>

            <h4>Healthy Monitors</h4>
            <p>When this reaction receives a "Healthy Monitor" the reaction will first check the monitors previous status, if the previous status was "Failed" the reaction will send an email notification that includes the name of the Monitor that has been restored. If the previous status was "Healthy" this reaction will perform no tasks.</p>
