            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p>The Amazon Web Services: Start EC2 Instance reaction can be used to start cloud servers (aka Instances) hosted with Amazon Web Services.</p>

            <p></p>
            <h3>Reaction Actions</h3>

            <p>This reaction will only perform a single reaction, this reaction can be configured to occur on "Failed Monitors" or "Healthy Monitors" but is not designed to be executed on both. In order to setup this reaction to have an action for "Healthy Monitors" and a different action for "Failed Monitors" you can create two reactions and attach them to the same Monitor.</p>

            <p></p>
            <h4>Failed Monitors</h4>
            <p><b>If this reaction's Call On field is set to "Failed Monitors".</b></p>
            <p>When this reaction receives a "Failed Monitor" the reaction will send an API request to AWS requesting a start of the instance specified.</p>
            <p><b>If this reaction's Call On field is set to "Healthy Monitors".</b></p>
            <p>This reaction will perform no tasks when it receives a "Failed Monitor"</p>
            <p></p>
            <h4>Healthy Monitors</h4>
            <p><b>If this reaction's Call On field is set to "Healthy Monitors".</b></p>
            <p>When this reaction receives a "Healthy Monitor" the reaction will send an API request to AWS requesting a start of the instance specified.</p>
            <p><b>If this reaction's Call On field is set to "Failed Monitors".</b></p>
            <p>This reaction will perform no tasks when it receives a "Healthy Monitor"</p>
            <p></p>
