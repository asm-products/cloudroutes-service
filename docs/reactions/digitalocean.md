The DigitalOcean Reactions are designed to allow users to automatically perform common tasks on DigitalOcean cloud servers. These tasks could be for issue resolution or simply day to day tasks.

## Power Cycle Droplet

This reaction is designed to allow a user to perform a hard Power Cycle of a DigitalOcean cloud server. A power cycle in DigitalOcean is equivalent to pulling the power from a server. This reaction is useful as only a last resort, when all other reactions were unable to resolve the issue.

## Power On Droplet

This reaction is designed to allow a user to Power On a DigitalOcean cloud server. This reaction is a bit of an edge case but can be used to power on a server that will take over the role of a false server.

## Reboot Droplet

This reaction is designed to allow a user to Reboot a DigitalOcean cloud server. This is a soft reboot and is generally used when other reactions were unable to resolve the issue.

---

## Power Off Droplet

This reaction is designed to allow a user to Power Off a DigitalOcean cloud server. Much like the Power On reaction the use of this reaction is an edge case but for some situations it has it's uses.

---

## Shutdown Droplet

This reaction is designed to allow a user to Shutdown a DigitalOcean cloud server. The use of this reaction is the same as the Power Off reaction however this reaction performs a soft shutdown where the Power Off reaction is equivalent to pulling the power from a server.

## Snapshot Droplet

This reaction allows users to create a Snapshot of a DigitalOcean cloud server. This reaction may be useful for creating a quick backup of a misbehaving system for later analysis.
